This sample app has been built using MVVM architecture, UIKit for view controllers/ views & Combine for networking. 

Diffable Data sources and Compisitional Layout have been used for the collection view to help scale if we introduce sections or adopt sections with different scrolls.

The Client ID and Client Secret can be updated in `Resources` -> `DebugConfig.xconfig` and `ReleaseConfig.xconfig`
